# Roadmap

Memento Mori Jester is usable today as a CLI, MCP server, GitHub Action, and git-hook helper. The next work is about making it easier to adopt and harder to misuse.

## Near Term

- More config presets for common stacks and risk profiles.
- Better rule explanations and fewer false-positive cautions as real usage accumulates.

## Recently Shipped

- Agent setup chooser for Codex, Claude Code, and generic MCP clients.
- Local paste-in playground for commands, plans, diffs, and final answers.
- README demo snapshot generated as a small deterministic SVG.

## Product Ideas

- A guided first-run flow that combines preset selection, agent setup, playground smoke checks, and optional git hooks.

## Quality And Safety

- Keep all checks local and deterministic unless the user explicitly asks for hosted services.
- Keep destructive commands blocked by default.
- Keep project-specific config transparent in `jester.config.json`.
- Avoid long-lived npm tokens by using trusted publishing.

## Not Planned Right Now

- Sending project code to a hosted API.
- Replacing human review.
- Auto-running commands that were only meant to be reviewed.
